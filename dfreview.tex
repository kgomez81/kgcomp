\section{Introduction}
Our understanding of beneficial mutations and their dynamics is comparatively less developed than it is for neutral and deleterious mutations.  The detailed work carried out for the latter two has provided important insights into genetic diversity in populations and led to development of important tools to study and characterize key evolutionary processes in species.  However, beneficial mutations play a much more fundamental role in the long-term adaptation of species, and they also greatly influence the levels of genetic diversity at linked sites.  Unfortunately, our understanding of them limited to the simplest cases due to the complexity often involved in the biological scenarios where positive selection occurs.  This makes the work of Desai and Fisher an important contribution to the existing body of theoretical literature on beneficial mutations, and in particular, their detailed analysis provides a solid framework for modeling adaptation in asexual populations.  

The rate $U_b$ at which beneficial mutations occur determines the dynamics of long-term adaptation, assuming that magnitude of their selective advantage $s$ is large enough to dominate drift determined by the population size $N$. 

There are two regimes of interest, which have been investigated to some extent in past work.  In the first of these, positive selection is characterized by fairly simple dynamics, which are well understood.  The second regime leads to much more complicated behavior, where prior efforts to properly model the dynamics have been incomplete (FIX).  This second regime is the focus of the paper, starting with the simplest model, followed by an exploration of it's application to more complicated situations associated with the relaxation of certain assumptions      

The simplest regime, known as the strong-selection weak-mutation regime, occurs when the average time between appearances of beneficial mutations is much larger than the time required for selection to fix a beneficial mutations.  In this particular scenario, selection purges variation in fitness much quicker than it can be introduced into the population, which results in a succession of a single ruling classes composed of identically fit individuals.  For this reason, it is referred to as the successional regime.  

The second is the strong-selection strong-mutation regime, which occurs when the time between appearances of beneficial mutations is comparable to or smaller than time needed for beneficial mutations to fix in the population.  In this particular regime, selection fails to purge any variation in fitness before more is introduced with the appearance of the next beneficial mutation.  It is denoted the concurrent mutations regime due to the fact that these dynamics give rise a population with concurrent clonal subpopulations with distinct fitnesses.     

initially focus on describing the a much simpler scenario where in only beneficial mutations of equal strength are accounted for, and their occurrence if frequent enough so that at any point in time multiple mutants are present in the populations and in direct competition.  This of course ignores complications, such as epistasis effects, frequency dependent benefits, and environmental changes, but in turn make it possible to derive a good understanding of the fundamental dynamics of long-term adaptation in asexual populations.  

their diversity can be incredibly complicated.  Desai and Fisher highlight a number of these in their brief talk regarding positive selection Long-term adaptation ranges from complicated scenarios involving a number of evolutionary processes, to the most simplistic in which beneficial mutations and positive selection are the primary forces determining the changes of the gene pool in populations.  The initial development of the model relies on taking the simplest of assumptions for 

\section{The Simple Model}
The there are three parameters that determine the key behavior of adaptations in clonal populations, which are the population size $N$, the beneficial mutation rate $U_b$, and the selective advantage $s$.  What is  

The second is the strong-selection strong-mutation regime and it is referred to as the \textit{concurrent-mutations regime}. In this regime, beneficial mutations occur much more frequently, as is the case in larger populations sizes where $NU \gg 1$.  Selection is assumed to be strong and not dominated by drift.  Consequently, the time between occurrences of beneficial mutations is shorter than the time required for each to fix in the populations.  This results in the a situation where selective sweeps can overlap. This leads to what is know as clonal interference, whereby competing beneficial mutations within the population compete for fixation. Desai and Fisher point out clonal populations are known to operate in this regime, such as in some viral, bacterial and simple eukaryotic populations.  Desai and Fisher's article focuses on the clonal interference which occurs when clonal populations are in the concurrent mutations regime.  

Beneficial mutations are needed to contribute to new genetic variation, while selection eliminates on standing variation.  Desai and Fisher point out the need to understand the interplay between selection and beneficial mutations as they affect the variation in the population, in particular the selection-mutation balance.  Some comments are made on the distinct regime where mutations are weakly beneficial, in which case drift dominates and impedes their fixation through selection.  This regime occurs in small populations, where drift is much stronger than selection, or when beneficial mutations have a very weak effect, such as in the case of synonymous codon usage.  Desai and Fisher choose to focus on the moderate to large populations in strong selection regimes where drift is only important for very small subpopulations.  The figure is discussed and a comparison is drawn between the successional and concurrent mutations regimes.  As mentioned previously, the successional case occurs in small populations sizes or when $U_b$ is small so that beneficial mutations are rare and their occurrences are seperated in time.

In their model, they assume that the population size $N$ is constant.  They denote $U_b$ as the beneficial mutation rate and the fitness increase from each   mutation as $s$ (this is the log fitness).  The speed of evolution $v$ is $d\langle r \rangle / dt$ which is the rate of increase of average fitness in the population.  If the fittest mutant has advantage $ks$ over the mean, then the speed of evolution can be written as the $v=sd\langle k  / dt \rangle$.  

Desai and Fisher proceed with a simple discussion of how mutants establish in the successional regime.  Beneficial mutations occur at total rate of $NU_b$, and a mutant and the probability for it to survive drift is proportional to $s$, provided $1/N<s<1$.  Establishment occurs if the beneficial mutation survives drift, which occurs roughly when the mutant subpopulation reaches size $1/s$.  The reasoning behind this is that for a lineage of size $n$, it takes roughly $n$ generations for drift to change the population size by $n$ individuals, while selection adds $n(1+s)^n-n \approx n^2s$.  Hence if $n^2s>n$, then selection dominates drift, which exactly states that $n>1/s$ is required in order for the mutant lineage to be safe from drift. 

As a result, the mutant lineage will produce beneficial mutations that establish at a total rate of $NU_bs$ per generation, and thus, a new beneficial mutation will establish every $\tau_{establish} = 1/NU_bs$ generations.  Having reached the size $1/s$, the mutant lineage grows almost exponentially at rate $s$, which implies that the time until fixation is given by
\[
N={1 \over s}e^{s \tau_{fix}}.
\]
solving for the fixation time, we obtain $\tau_{fix}=ln(Ns)/s$ generations are required for the beneficial mutation to fix in the population.  
The calculations for the generating function are given as follows. The for
